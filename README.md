# Advanced Laboratory
At the National Laboratories of Legnaro there are several accelerators capable of providing different beams in various energy ranges. In particular, the AN2000 could provide proton and alpha beams in a range from 500 keV up to 2 MeV. Its beam energy is determined by the feedback from the bending magnet at the exit of the accelerator. By using different resonance scans, with well-known energy, we could associate the real beam energy with the nominal one according to the magnet field. The resonance scans will also provide other important information about the beam spread and other accelerator parameters. Once this is done, having characterized the beam at our disposal and calibrated the accelerator in terms of energy, we can proceed with measurements concerning the reactions of our interest. Specifically, we performed a scan of the reaction $^{14}$N(p,$\gamma$)$^{15}$O at beam energies around 1058 keV, necessary to obtain the excited state of Oxygen located at 8284 keV, measuring the resonance strength and comparing it with previous measurements of the same quantity.
